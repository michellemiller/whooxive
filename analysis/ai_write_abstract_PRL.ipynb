In this work we reverse this research program and ask what do the randomness certification capabilities of a theory tell us about the nonlocality of that theory. We find that contrary to initial intuition maximally nonlocal theories cannot allow maximal randomness certification. We go on and show that quantum theory in contrast permits certification of maximal randomness in all dichotomic scenarios.
