Repulsive forces separate particles in free space.]]] However in a structured environment such as a periodic potential and in the absence of dissipation stable composite objects can exist even for repulsive interactions. Here we report on the first observation of such an exotic bound state comprised of a pair of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. Consistent with our theoretical analysis these repulsively bound pairs exhibit long lifetimes even under collisions with one another. Signatures of the pairs are also recognised in the characteristic momentum distribution and through spectroscopic measurements. There is no analogue in traditional condensed matter systems of such repulsively bound pairs due to the presence of strong decay channels. These results exemplify on a new level the strong correspondence between the optical lattice physics of ultracold bosonic atoms and the Bose Hubbard model a correspondence which is vital for future applications of these systems to the study of strongly correlated condensed matter systems and to quantum information.\n",

      "Existing abstract: The presence of long range quantum spin correlations underlies a variety of physical phenomena in condensed matter systems potentially including high temperature superconductivity. However many properties of exotic strongly correlated spin systems e.g. spin liquids have proved difficult to study in part because calculations involving N body entanglement become intractable for as few as N ## particles. Feynman divined that a quantum simulator a special purpose analog processor built using quantum particles qubits would be inherently adept at such problems. In the context of quantum magnetism a number of experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. However simulations of quantum magnetism allowing controlled tunable interactions between spins localized on #D and #D lattices of more than a few ## s of qubits have yet to be demonstrated owing in part to the technical challenge of realizing large scale qubit arrays. Here we demonstrate a variable range Ising type spin spin interaction J ij on a naturally occurring #D triangular crystal lattice of hundreds of spin # # particles #Be ions stored in a Penning trap a computationally relevant scale more than an order [[[of magnitude larger than existing experiments.

This demonstration coupled with the high spin count excellent quantum control and low technical complexity of the Penning trap brings within reach simulation of interesting and otherwise computationally intractable problems in quantum magnetism.\n",

      "Existing abstract: Antiferromagnetism is relevant to high temperature high Tc superconductivity because copper oxide and iron arsenide high Tc superconductors arise from electron or hole doping of their antiferromagnetic AF ordered parent compounds. There are two broad classes of explanation for the phenomenon of antiferromagnetism in the local moment picture appropriate for the insulating copper oxides AF interactions are well described by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian while in the itinerant model suitable for metallic chromium AF order arises from quasiparticle excitations of a nested Fermi surface. There has been contradictory evidence regarding [[[the microscopic origin of the AF order in iron arsenide materials with some favoring a localized picture while others supporting an itinerant point of view.

We find that the spin waves in the entire Brillouin zone can be described by an effective three dimensional local moment Heisenberg Hamiltonian but the large in plane anisotropy cannot. Therefore magnetism in the parent compounds of iron arsenide superconductors is neither purely local nor purely itinerant rather it is a complicated mix of the two.\n",

The value of this minimum level is very uncertain but is likely to be present in cometary ices include water simple hydrocarbons oxygen sulfur and nitrogen bearing species as well as a Lifshitz transition with a change of Fermi surface topology.

      "Existing abstract: In quantum physics Efimov trimers are bound states of three particles that fall apart like Borromean rings when one of them is removed. Initially predicted in nuclear physics these striking bosonic states are hard to observe but the unitary interactions at which they form is commonly realized in current cold atoms experiments. There they set the stage for a new class of universal physics Two body interactions are all but invisible but three body effects allow the emergence of a largely uncharted new world of many particle bound states. Three particle systems were characterized theoretically and the ground state properties of small unitary clusters computed numerically but the macroscopic many body behaviour has remained unknown. Here we show using a Path Integral Monte Carlo algorithm backed up by theoretical arguments that the unitary Bose gas presents a first order phase transition from a normal gas to a superfluid Efimov liquid. The normal gas is very well described by the available virial coefficients. At unitarity the [[[phase diagram of the bosonic system is universal in rescaled pressure and temperature.

These two superfluid phases are separated by a critical line that ends in a critical point at high temperature. This rich phase diagram should allow for a number of experimental protocols that would probe these universal transitions between the normal gas the superfluid gas and the superfluid Efimov liquid.\n",

We demonstrate that by using very high magnetic fields it is possible to make an accurate and direct spectroscopic measurement of the exciton binding energy which we find to be strikingly different from the predictions of single particle theory. The states are mainly determined by Coulomb interactions and appear only when quantization of kinetic energy limits the screening ability of electrons. We conclude that the quantum Hall effect has a greater diversity of regimes and phase transitions than predicted by the single particle framework. Our experiments suggest a unified picture of localization in which the single particle model is valid only in the limit of strong interactions and defies a conventional BCS description.\n",
