      "Ultracold atomic gases confined to optical lattices have proven to be highly versatile and tunable systems for realizing novel quantum states of matter. We are using Fermi gases of $^6$Li atoms in our laboratory to explore several goals related to the strong correlations that arise in these systems. We have realized the Hubbard model, which has long been suspected of containing the essential ingredients of high temperature superconductivity. We measured the compressibility of the Mott insulating phase that occurs near half filling (1 atom/site), thus demonstrating the excitation gap of the Mott insulator. Progress in this field, however, has been hampered by an inability to cool to low enough temperatures to achieve the most ambitious goals. To address this problem, we have developed the compensated optical lattice method to enable evaporative cooling in the lattice. With this method, we have cooled the Mott insulator sufficiently far to observe short-range antiferromagnetic correlations using Bragg scattering of light. We are currently exploring new methods for entropy storage and redistribution to achieve even lower entropy in the antiferromagnetic phase.\n",
      "Motivated by the enhancement of quantum correlations in low dimensions, we are also exploring Fermi gases in quasi-one-dimension (1D). A deep 2D optical lattice produces an array of 1D tubes which can be weakly coupled by reducing the lattice depth, thus increasing the lattice hopping $t$ between them. We observe a crossover from 1D-like to 3D-like behavior in the phase separation of a spin-imbalanced Fermi gas with increasing $t$. While this crossover occurs at a value of $t$ that depends on interaction, we find that the crossover location is universally dependent upon the scaled hopping $t / \\varepsilon_\\mathrm{b}$, where $\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{b}$ is the pair binding energy. Finally, I will also report progress on measuring the speed of sound of the charge and spin modes in a 1D Fermi gas.\n",

      "We have performed a series of experiments with ring-shaped Bose-Einstein Condensates, with and without the addition of a “weak link” barrier. Weak connections between superconductors or superfluids can differ from classical links due to quantum coherence, which allows for flow without resistance. The properties of a weak link are characterized by a single function, the current-phase relationship. In recent experiments, we have developed a technique to directly measure the current-phase relationship of the weak link. The weak link is created using a laser beam that acts as a barrier across one side of the ring condensate.  By rotating the barrier, we can control the current around the ring. When the weak link is rotated at at low rotation rates, we observe phase slips between well-defined, quantized current states, and have demonstrated that the system exhibits hysteresis. At higher rotation rates we have directly measured the onset of resistive flow across the weak link.  Such measurements may open new avenues of research in quantum transport. More recently, we have studied the behavior of the ring BEC when the radius is expanded at supersonic rates. Because information can propagate only at the speed of sound, the supersonic expansion creates causally disconnected regions, whose phases evolve at different rates. Such experiments may allow us to study cosmic inflation at laboratory scales.\n"

The microwave transition is from the (n+2)p(n-2)f part of the wavefunction to the (n+1)d(n-2)f state.

One might expect that the loosely bound electron would be ionized by modest electromagnetic field. However, experiments show that a notable fraction of neutral atoms survive in Rydberg states when exposed to strong microwave or laser fields. Energy transfer between the field and the photoelectron occurs when the electron is close to the ionic core and depends on the phase of the field. Since those states have orbital times that can be larger than the field pulse duration, these energy exchanges will only occur a few times. While we can experimentally control the initial time when we create the Rydberg states and as a consequence the initial energy transfer from the field, our classical calculation suggests that the phase when the electron is returning to the ionic core on the next orbit is chaotic.

The overset grid method uses multiple numerical grids, for instance Finite Element Method - Discrete Variable Representation (FEM-DVR) grids, expanded radially around multiple centers (corresponding to the individual atoms in each molecule as well as the center-of-mass of the molecule). The use of this flexible grid allows the complex angular dependence of the wavefunctions near the atomic centers to be well-described, but also allows scattering wavefunctions that oscillate rapidly at large distances to be accurately represented. Additionally, due to the use of multiple grids (and also grid shells), the method is easily parallelizable. The method has been implemented in ePolyscat, a multipurpose suite of programs for general molecular scattering calculations. It is interfaced with a number of quantum chemistry programs (including MolPro, Gaussian, GAMESS, and Columbus), from which it can read molecular orbitals and wavefunctions obtained using standard computational chemistry methods.

The principle of the ``weak measurement\" process was first proposed by Aharonov, Albert and Vaidman [1], and describes a scenario in which a system is weakly coupled to a pointer between well-defined pre- and post-selected states. This experiment will utilise a pulsed supersonic beam of spin-1 metastable Helium (He*) atoms in the $2^{3}S_{1}$ state. The spin of the pre-selected He* atoms will be weakly coupled to its centre-of-mass. During its flight, the atomic beam will be prepared in a desired quantum state and travel through two inhomogeneous magnets (weak and strong) which both comprise the ``weak measurement\" process. The deviation of the post-selected $m_{s} =+1$ state as measured using a micro-channel plate, phosphor screen and CCD camera setup will allow for the determination of the weak value of spin.
