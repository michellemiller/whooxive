We find conditions for the photon statistics that guarantee generation of entanglement in the relevant qubit subspaces and compare it with classicality criteria. We also quantify the amount of entanglement that can be produced with imperfect single photon sources optimized over setup parameters using as a measure entanglement of formation. Finally we discuss verification of the generated entanglement by testing Bell s inequalities. The analysis is carried out for two schemes. The first one is the well established one photon scheme which produces a photon in a delocalized superposition state between two nodes each of them fed with one single photon at the input. As the second scheme we introduce and analyze a linear optics analog of the robust scheme based on interfering two Stokes photons emitted by atomic ensembles which does not require phase stability between the nodes.\n",

      "Existing abstract: The Copenhagen interpretation has been remarkably successful but seems at odds with the underlying linearity of quantum mechanics. We show how it can emerge in a simple way from the underlying microscopic quantum world governed [[[by Schrodinger s equation without the need for]]] observers or their brains. In order to achieve this we assemble pieces of various pre existing ideas. Firstly we adopt a relational approach and use the eigenvectors of the reduced density matrix of a quantum sub system or equivalently the Schmidt decomposition to define the internal state of a sub system. Previous work has identified serious objections to such an interpretation because it apparently leads to macroscopic superpositions and physically unacceptable instabilities near degeneracies. We show that both these problems are solved if the sub system consists of a large number of coarse grained degrees of freedom as one expects in order to make contact with the classical world. We further argue that coarse graining is a necessary ingredient because measuring devices have both finite spatial and temporal resolutions. What results is an interpretation in which both decoherence and coarse graining play key roles and from which the rules of the Copenhagen interpretation are seen to emerge in realistic situations that include the measurement of the position of a particle and a decay process.\n",
