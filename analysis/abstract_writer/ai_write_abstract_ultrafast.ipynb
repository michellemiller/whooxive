The accumulation of coherence at different radial locations within the atomic beam cross section as a function of the number of pulses in the train is also reported. We find that pulse train with lower repetition frequencies are able to generate high and nearly uniform coherence in a substantial part of the atomic system.\n",

      "New abstract: The feasibility of generation of bright ultrashort gamma ray pulses is demonstrated in the interaction of a relativistic electron bunch with a counterpropagating tightly focused superstrong laser beam in the radiation dominated regime. The Compton scattering spectra of gamma radiation are investigated using a semiclassical description for the electron dynamics in the molecular ion can be understood via the phase difference accumulated between the Coulomb wells at the two protons.

      "Existing abstract: We analyze the attosecond electron dynamics in hydrogen molecular ion driven by an external intense laser field using ab initio numerical simulations of the corresponding time dependent Schr o dinger equation and Bohmian trajectories. To this end we employ a one dimensional model of the molecular ion in which the motion of the protons is frozen. The results of the Bohmian trajectory calculations do agree well with those of the ab initio simulations and clearly visualize the electron transfer between the two protons in the field. In particular the Bohmian trajectory calculations confirm the recently predicted attosecond transient localization of the electron at one of the protons and the related multiple bunches of the ionization current within a half cycle of the laser field. Further analysis based on the quantum trajectories shows that [[[the electron dynamics in the molecular ion can be understood via the phase difference accumulated between the Coulomb wells at the two protons.
