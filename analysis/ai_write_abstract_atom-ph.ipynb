The manifestation of dipole dipole interactions is a self broadening contribution to the homogeneous linewidth which grows linearly with number density of atoms.

      "New abstract: The recently developed notion of parity time PT symmetry in optical systems with a controlled gain loss interplay has spawned an intriguing way of achieving optical behaviors that are presently unattainable with standard arrangements. In most experimental studies so far however the implementations rely highly on the advances of nanotechnologies and sophisticated fabrication techniques to synthesize solid state materials. Here we report the first spectroscopic observation of the resonant dipole dipole interaction between two Rydberg atoms depends on the relative orientation of the atoms and on the change in the magnetic quantum number. We simulate the effect of this anisotropy on the energy transport in an amorphous many atom system subject to a homogeneous applied electric field. We consider two experimentally feasible geometries and find that the effects should be measurable in current generation imaging experiments. In both geometries atoms of p character are localized to a small region of space which is immersed in a larger region that is filled with atoms of s character. Energy transfer due to the dipole dipole interaction reveals explicit manifestation of strong localization under some conditions.\n",

As the frequency of Rabi oscillations between collective states of Rydberg blockaded ensembles depends on the number of interacting atoms for randomly loaded optical dipole traps we predict collapses and revivals of Rabi oscillations.

With alkali metal atoms and in particular with ## Rb a proper choice of transitions enables both the potential generation and optical pumping thus polarizing the sample in a given Zeeman state. We extend the Dalibard and Cohen Tannoudji dressed atom model of radiative forces to the case of a three level system. We derive expressions for the average force and the different sources of momentum diffusion in the resonant non perturbative regime. We show using numerical simulations that a significant fraction of the atoms initially loaded can be guided over several centimeters with output velocities of a few meters per second. This would produce a collimated continuous source of slow spin polarized atoms suitable for atom interferometry.\n",

      "New abstract: Despite being a canonical example of quantum mechanical perturbation theory as well as one of the earliest observed spectroscopic shifts the Stark effect contributes the largest source of uncertainty in the new generation of optical frequency standards. Accurate polarizabilities for the group I and II atoms and ions of the periodic table have recently become available by a variety of techniques. These include refined many body perturbation theory and the coupled cluster method in the framework of the Bose Hubbard model. Near the superfluid Mott transition the vortex core has a tendency toward the Mott insulating phase with the core particle density approaching the nearest commensurate value. If the nearest neighbor repulsion exists the charge density wave order may develop locally in the core. The evolution of the vortex configuration from the strong to weak coupling regions is studied. This phenomenon can be observed in systems of rotating ultra cold atoms in optical lattices or coupled photonic structures. Recently it was predicted that several solid state quantum localisation phenomena Anderson localisation Bloch oscillations and Tamm Shockley surface states may manifest themselves in the rotational dynamics of laser kicked molecules.
