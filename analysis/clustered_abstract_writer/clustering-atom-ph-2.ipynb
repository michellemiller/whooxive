These modifications have been investigated by different groups using global analyses of high energy nuclear reaction world data resulting in modern nPDF parametrizations with error estimates such as EPS## s HKN## and nDS. These phenomenological nPDF sets roughly agree within their uncertainty bands but have antiquarks for large x and gluons for the whole x range poorly constrained by the available data. In the kinematics accessible at the LHC this has negative impact on the interpretation of the heavy ion collision data especially for the p A benchmarking runs. The EMC region is also sensitive to the proper definition of x where the nuclear binding effects have to be taken into account and for heavy nuclei one also needs to take into account that a fraction of the nucleus momentum is carried by the equivalent photons which modifies the momentum sum rule. We study how these effects affect the predictions for the nuclear modification ratios at the LHC kinematics using a [[[model where we combine theoretical input for the leading twist nuclear shadowing the FGS model and the EKS##s EPS##s nPDF set where the spatial dependence is formulated as a]]] power series of the nuclear thickness functions T A .\n",

      "Existing abstract: Hanle scattering is an important diagnostic tool to study weak solar magnetic fields. Partial frequency redistribution PRD is necessary to interpret the linear polarization observed in strong resonance lines. Usually angle averaged PRD functions are used to analyze linear polarization. However it is established that angle dependent PRD functions are often necessary to interpret polarization profiles formed in the presence of weak magnetic fields. Our aim is to present an efficient decomposition technique and the numerical method to solve the concerned angle dependent line transfer problem. Together with the standard Stokes decomposition technique we employ Fourier expansion over the outgoing azimuth angle to express in a more convenient form the angle dependent PRD function for the Hanle effect. It allows the use of angle dependent frequency domains of Bommier to solve the Hanle transfer problem. Such an approach is self consistent and accurate compared to a recent approach where angle averaged frequency domains were used to solve the same problem. We show that it is necessary to incorporate angle dependent frequency domains instead of angle averaged frequency domains to solve the Hanle transfer problem accurately especially for the Stokes U parameter. The importance of using angle dependent domains has been highlighted by taking the example of Hanle effect in the case of line transfer with vertical magnetic fields in a slab atmosphere. We have also studied the case of polarized line formation when micro turbulent magnetic fields are present. The difference between angle averaged and angle dependent solutions is enhanced [[[by the presence of micro turbulent]]] fields.\n",

In one region close to zero temperature the self energy depends on the frequency only weakly at low energy. On the other hand in the region close [[[to the critical temperature the self energy shows a pole structure.

At a mesoscopic scale only the energies of the macroscopic bodies are accessible together with the configurations of the contact system. We consider a class of models where the contact system as well as macroscopic bodies have a finite number of possible configurations. The global system with only discrete degrees of freedom has no microscopic Hamiltonian dynamics but it is shown that if the microscopic dynamics is assumed to be deterministic and ergodic and to conserve energy according to some specific pattern and if the mesoscopic evolution of the global system is approximated by a Markov process as closely as possible then the mesoscopic transition rates obey three constraints. In the limit where macroscopic bodies can be considered as reservoirs at thermodynamic equilibrium but with different intensive parameters the mesoscopic transition rates turn into transition rates for the contact system and the third constraint becomes local detailed balance the latter is generically expressed in terms of the microscopic exchange entropy variation namely the opposite of the variation of the thermodynamic entropy of the reservoir involved in a given microscopic jump of the contact system configuration.

We discuss the sampling formulae species occupancy distributions frequency of frequencies in this context.

It is shown that it always makes sense to study these occupancy problems from a Gibbs Poisson abundance model in the context of a population with infinitely many species. From this extension a parameter gamma naturally appears which is a measure of richness or diversity of species. We rederive the sampling formulae for a population with infinitely many species together with the distribution of the number P k of distinct sampled species. We investigate the estimation of gamma problem from the sample size k and the observed value of P k . We then exhibit a large special class of Gibbs Poisson distributions having the property that sampling from a discrete abundance model may equivalently be viewed as a sampling problem from a random partition of unity now in the continuum. When n is finite this partition may be built upon normalizing n infinitely divisible iid positive random variables by its partial sum.

      "New abstract: We propose a theoretical approach to study the beta decay rates of heavy nuclei such as iron or silicon. If the number density of created particles exhibits two different characteristics. For a small laser frequency the particle number density to the nucleation rate and the nucleation time due to quantum and thermal fluctuations of the hydrodynamic variables. Starting from the known unfaithful spinorial representations of the compact subalgebra K E## of the split real hyperbolic Kac Moody algebra AE #. Some exponentials of these operators generate a spinorial extension of the Weyl C algebra. In this paper we take into account the rest mass of the electron pairs in agreement with previous investigation. In addition our results show that it is possible to resolve the B to pi form factors from light cone sum rules match that derived in QCD factorization. In particular we perform accurate computations of the bound triplet S P D F and G states in the four electron Be atom. For the ##S L # state in the Be atom we also determine a number of bound states properties and the hyperfine structure in ultracold rubidium aimed at control of population dynamics and quantum state preparation. We discuss a method\n",
